Autonomous driving is a rapidly growing field that relies heavily on robust computer vision systems for real-time decision-making and navigation. One of the most critical tasks in this domain is object detection which is the ability to identify and localize various objects in the vehicleâ€™s surroundings [1]. This report presents a practical implementation of object detection using YOLOv8, current advanced model applied to the KITTI dataset. The project focuses on getting and preparing data, selecting models, training, evaluating, and making sense of the results to imitate real-world robotic perception tasks.
